# ShulkerRespawner 
This is a plugin that allows shulkers to respawn in the end.

It works by allowing any enderman that spawns on a purpur block to transform into a shulker,
so long as there are no other shulkers within a 10 block radius.

You are able to set the language for the plugin to use by changing the `lang` attribute in the config file.
